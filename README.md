# Advice-Complexity-of-CNN-Problem
The advice complexity of online algorithms has improved the performance of online algorithms by analyzing the problem and the input data and feeding the algorithms with some useful information based on the analysis to make some right decisions. A significant amount of research has been done on ‘k-server’ problem with advice. The main objective of this paper is to improve the competitiveness of an important variant of online k-server problem called the CNN problem by introducing the concept of advice. The paper discusses the lower and upper bounds of the size of advice bits required to achieve an optimal solution in various types of CNN problem including 1 server and multi-server variant.
